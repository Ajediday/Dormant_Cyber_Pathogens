So you want to make some stickers?

What you need:

Some program to design your sticker (Photoshop, Paint, whatever)
Inkjet printer
Avery Self-Adhesive Laminating Sheets, 9" x 12", Pack of 10 (73603)
	Available at Amazon for $6.99 (optional but it makes the stickers look nicer)
Cricut Printable Vinyl 8.5" x 11", Pack of 10
	Available at Michaels for $9.99 (maybe cheaper with coupon)
Sissors (Sharp thing to cut with)
Time

1) Design your sticker. Keep in mind that things like rounded corners, look cool
but are a pain to cut out.  
2) Layout your design on a 8.5 x 11 sheet, keep the layout simple, you might have waste,
but if it saves you time in cutting them out, it might be worth it.
3) Print it.
4) If you are using the laminating sheets, put that over the printed sheet.  The sheets
I picked are large, but the texture works for me.  I use a cool seal laminator which is just a
simple press.
5) Cut the stickers out.
6) Distribute stickers.
7) Enjoy.
