The old photoshop files for the original sticker are here.

Also here is a pdf walking thru what I do to make stickers.

I need to update the pdf with the details on the "security seals" which use Avery 8665 Full Sheet Clear Shipping labels.  Clear really isn't that clear :)  No laminate used for the seals.  Design, print, and cut.

Update on Laminate:
I was using this:
Avery Self-Adhesive Laminating Sheets, 9" x 12", Pack of 10 (73603)
https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006IC7H
10 sheets for $9.43 as of this writing.

A MUCH better deal is this:
Avery Self-Adhesive Laminating Sheets, 9 x 12 Inches, Box of 50 (73601)
https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00007E7D2
50 sheets for $11.28

THE SAME STUFF.

The vinyl sticker sheets: Check Cricut.com for deals, sometimes they will have discounts.
